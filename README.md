# 2-flank-SPIM_Jolly_Seber
Spatial Jolly-Seber models with 2-flank SPIM observation process from Augustine et al. (2018)


Currently just 1 version that considers fixed activity centers across primary periods and camera numbers at trapping stations that do not change through time (e.g., if 1 cam at a 2 cam station fails, no mechanism to account for that, will upload this functionality later, see regular 2-flank SPIM repository).

These models use count prior data augmentation: https://github.com/benaug/SCR-Count-Prior-Data-Augmentation
